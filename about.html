		This upcoming summer he will be working for the company Collins Aerospace using Visual Basic to create windows for their Aerospace software. During the school
		year I am a student worker at the Tech Desk and help troubleshoot problems pertaining to personal computers as well as faculty equipment. In my free time I enjoy
